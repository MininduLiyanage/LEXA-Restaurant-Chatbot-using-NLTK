# LEXA-Restaurant-Chatbot-using-NLTK

LEXA is an AI-powered chatbot designed for restaurant interactions, implemented using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). 

The chatbot model utilizes NLP techniques such as bag of words, tokenizing, and stemming to understand and respond to user queries. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model has been trained on a self-created dataset containing various intents, each associated with different tags and responses tailored for restaurant-related inquiries.
